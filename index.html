					<ul>
						<li>Check that site structure and plug-ins is stable and appropriate, and provide support troubleshooting and fixing any issues that arise</li>
						<li>Redesign the homepage, review content types and key landing pages to make tweaks to improve design and better align with existing brand guidelines (as needed), and make the styling more consistent throughout the site</li>

					<h2>Questions for Client</h2>
					<p>After reviewing the staging site, and looking over the provided requirements for the site overhaul, I have a few questions below.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>I've noticed that the multi-language plugin, <a href="https://wpml.org/purchase/" target="_blank">WPML</a> has an expired account license. Will you be renewing the license on this plugin before we begin work on the site? It is recommended that this subscription is activated before I begin any work, as it will improve workflow and unblock any hurdles with regards to changes that need to be made to the bilingual portion of the site.</p>
							<p>Another instance of an outdated/expired plugin account is with the plugin used for the <a href="https://smashballoon.com/custom-twitter-feeds/pricing/" target="_blank">Twitter Feed</a>. Is there a plan to renew this subscription, or are you wanting me to source another plugin that doesn't require a paid subscription?</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>For the home page re-design, do you have an idea of what call to actions are needed? Can you provide a list of what content is most important, for example, what content should be displayed above the fold, and how would you like the user to interact with the site so that they can reach the right personnel on MSSU's end when they have inquiries. A content hierarchy doc would be great as a starting point, so that I may provide a wire frame to properly outline the layout for content modeling in the design/development process.</p>
							<p>As well, are you able to define which design elements are to be kept, and which ones should be improved? I have an idea already of how things can be improved, but I would appreciate initial documentation on what the team thinks is working, and what is not with the staging site design.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Is the French content ready for population, or does it still need to be translated in some cases? I'd like to get an idea of how much content there is left to populate, as content population tends to eat up a lot of time.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>For site training, do you prefer a manual or an in-person tutorial? My gut is telling me that a tutorial might make more sense, as the bulk of the site has already been built by the other vendor. I don't plan to change things up too much in terms of how pages are created, content is added, etc.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>I recall in our meeting, that there was talk of the search functionality perhaps not working as expected. Are you able to elaborate on specific issues that have cropped up with it?</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Do you plan on having SEO improvements done to the site? This is something that would be outside of the scope of this project, and SEO is not something that I do directly, but I do have an excellent SEO partner with whom I've worked on many projects in the past with great results. I can put you in touch if needed.</p>
